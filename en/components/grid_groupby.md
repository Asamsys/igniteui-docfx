### Grid Group By

[`igxGrid`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html) supports column grouping that allows for visualizing data records in hierarchical groups according to the column group values. Groups can be expanded or collapsed and the order of grouping may be changed through the UI or API.


#### Demo

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height:605px">
    <iframe id="grid-sample-groupby-iframe" src='{environment:demosBaseUrl}/grid-groupby' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>
<div>
<button data-localize="stackblitz" disabled class="stackblitz-btn" data-iframe-id="grid-sample-groupby-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}">view on stackblitz</button>
</div>

#### Initial Grouping State

It is possible to set the initial grouping of the grid by an array of expressions to the [`groupingExpressions`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupingexpressions) property of the grid.

```typescript
public ngOnInit() {
    grid.groupingExpressions = [
        { fieldName: 'ProductName', dir: SortingDirection.Desc },
        { fieldName: 'Released', dir: SortingDirection.Desc }
    ];
}
```

Grouping expressions implement the [`ISortingExpression`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/isortingexpression.html) interface.

#### Group By API

Grouping is available through the UI and through a robust API exposed by the grid component. Developers can allow end-users to group the grid data by certain columns, by setting each column's [`groupable`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcolumncomponent.html#groupable) property to `true`.

```html
<igx-grid [data]="data">
    <igx-column *ngFor="let c of columns" [field]="c.field" [groupable]="true">
    </igx-column>
</igx-grid>
```

```typescript
public ngOnInit() {
    grid.columns.forEach((column) => {
        column.groupable = true;
    });
}
```

During runtime the expressions are gettable and settable from the [`groupingExpressions`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupingexpressions) property. If you need to just add or change an existing expression you may also use the [`groupBy`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupby) method with either a single or an array of [`ISortingExpression`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/isortingexpression.html).

```typescript
grid.groupBy({ fieldName: 'ProductName', dir: SortingDirection.Desc, ignoreCase: true });
```

Grouping works in conjunction with sorting and grouping expressions are applied as sorting ones even though columns may be sorted without being grouped. You will always find the grouping expressions in the [`sortingExpression`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#sortingexpressions) property, sorted in a way that grouped columns' expressions are always first. The sorting API will affect grouping if it changes the expression for a column that is grouped. Removing a grouping expression (ungrouping a column) also unsorts it.

In addition to grouping expressions you can also control the expansion states for group rows. They are stored in a separate property of the [`igxGrid`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html) component [`groupingExpansionState`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupingexpansionstate). A group row is uniquely identified based on the field name it is created for and the value it represents for each level of grouping. This means that the signature of an expansion state interface is the following:

```typescript
export interface IGroupByKey {
    fieldName: string;
    value: any;
}

export interface IGroupByExpandState {
    hierarchy: Array<IGroupByKey>;
    expanded: boolean;
}
```

As with [`groupingExpressions`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupingexpressions), setting a list of [`IGroupByExpandState`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/igroupbyexpandstate.html) directly to the [`groupingExpansionState`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupingexpansionstate) will change the expansion accordingly. Additionally [`igxGrid`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html) exposes a method that toggles a group by the group record instance.

```typescript
    const groupRow = this.grid.groupsRecords.find(r => r.value === "France");
    grid.toggleGroup(groupRow);
```

Groups can be created expanded (***default***) or collapsed and the expansion states would generally only contain the state opposite to the default behavior. You can control whether groups should be created expanded or not through the [`groupsExpanded`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#groupsexpanded) property

#### Group Row Templates

The group row without its expand/collapse UI is fully templatable. By default it renders a grouping icon and displays the field name and value it represents. The grouping record the template is rendered against has the following signature:

```typescript
export interface IGroupByRecord {
    expression: ISortingExpression;
    level: number;
    records: GroupedRecords;
    value: any;
    groupParent: IGroupByRecord;
    groups?: IGroupByRecord[];
}
```

As an example, the following template would make the group rows summary more verbose:

```html
<ng-template igxGroupByRow let-groupRow>
    <span>Total items with value: {{ groupRow.value }} are {{ groupRow.records.length }}</span>
</ng-template>
```

#### Keyboard Navigation

The grouping UI supports the following keyboard interactions:

- For group rows (focus should be on the row or the expand/collapse cell)
   - <kbd>SPACE</kbd> - toggles the group

- For group [`igxChip`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxchipcomponent.html) components in the group by area (focus should be on the chip)
   - <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>LEFT</kbd> - moves the focused chip left, changing the grouping order, if possible
   - <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> - moves the focused chip right, changing the grouping order, if possible
   - <kbd>SPACE</kbd> - changes the sorting direction
   - <kbd>DELETE</kbd> - ungroups the field
   - The seperate elements of the chip are also focusable and can be interacted with using the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key.

### Known Limitations

|Limitation|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Maximum amount of grouped columns is 10. | If more than 10 columns are grouped an error is thrown.
