### Grid Column Pinning

For Ignite UI for Angular, **Column Pinning** is available through the `igx-grid` API. 

#### Demo

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height:550px">
    <iframe id="grid-sample-pinning-iframe" src='{environment:demosBaseUrl}/grid-sample-pinning' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<button data-localize="stackblitz" class="stackblitz-btn" data-iframe-id="grid-sample-pinning-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}">view on stackblitz</button>
</div>

#### Column Pinning API

Each column can be pinned, as long as the pinned area does not become wider than the grid itself. Column pinning is controlled through the pinned input of the `igx-column`. Pinned columns are always rendered on the left side of the grid and stay fixed through horizontal scrolling of the unpinned columns in the grid body.

```html
<igx-grid #grid1 [data]="data | async" [width]="700px" [autoGenerate]="false" [paging]="true" [perPage]="6" (onColumnInit)="initColumns($event)"
    (onSelection)="selectCell($event)">
    <igx-column [field]="Name" [pinned]="true"></igx-column>
    <igx-column [field]="AthleteNumber"></igx-column>
    <igx-column [field]="TrackProgress"></igx-column>
</igx-grid>
```

You may also use the grid's `pinColumn` or `unpinColumn` methods of the `IgxGridComponent` to pin or unpin columns by their field name:

```typescript
this.grid.pinColumn("AthleteNumber");
this.grid.unpinColumn("Name");
```

Both methods return a boolean value indicating whether their respective operation is successful or not. Usually the reason they fail is that the column is already in the desired state. `pinColumn` also fails when the result would mean that the pinned area becomes larger than or the same size as the grid itself. Consider the following example:

```html
<igx-grid #grid1 [data]="data | async" [width]="300px" [autoGenerate]="false">
    <igx-column [field]="Name" [width]="200px" [pinned]="true"></igx-column>
    <igx-column [field]="AthleteNumber" [width]="200px"></igx-column>
</igx-grid>
```

```typescript
var succeed = this.grid.pinColumn("AthleteNumber"); // pinning fails and succeed will be false
```

If pinning the `AthleteNumber` column is allowed the pinned area would exceed the grid's width.

A column is pinned to the right of the rightmost pinned column. Changing the order of the pinned columns can be done by subscribing to the `onColumnPinning` event and changing the `insertAtIndex` property of the event arguments to the desired position index.

```html
<igx-grid #grid1 [data]="data | async" [autoGenerate]="true" (onColumnPinning)="columnPinning($event)"></igx-grid>
```

```typescript
public columnPinning(event) {
    if (event.column.field === "Name") {
        event.insertAtIndex = 0;
    }
}
```

### Pinning Limitations

*   Setting column widths in percentage (%) explicitly makes the grid body and header content to be misaligned when there are pinned columns. For column pinning to function correctly the column widths should be in pixels (px) or auto-assigned by the grid.
