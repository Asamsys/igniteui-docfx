### Grid Batch Editing


[`TransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxtransactionservice.html) is an injectable middleware that a component can use to accumulate changes without affecting the underlying data. The provider exposes API to access, manipulate changes (undo and redo) and discard or commit all to the data.

The [`TransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxtransactionservice.html) works with both cell editing and row editing. The transaction for the cell edit is added when the cell exits edit mode, while row transaction is created, when the row exits edit mode. But in both cases the state of the grid edits consist of all updated, added and deleted rows and their last states. Those can later be inspected, manipulated and submitted at once. Changes are collected for individual cells or rows, depending on editing mode, and accumulated per data row/record.




#### Demo


The following sample demonstrates a scenario, where the grid has the Transaction as provider and has row editing enabled. The latter will ensure that transaction will be added after the entire row edit is confirmed.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height:650px">
    <iframe id="grid-batch-editing-sample-iframe" src='{environment:demosBaseUrl}/grid/grid-batch-editing' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<button data-localize="stackblitz" disabled class="stackblitz-btn" data-iframe-id="grid-batch-editing-sample-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}">view on stackblitz</button>
</div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>




> [!NOTE]
> Transaction state consists of all the updated, added and deleted rows and their last states.

### Usage

To get started import the `IgxGridModule` in the **app.module.ts** file:

```typescript
// app.module.ts

...
import { IgxGridModule } from 'igniteui-angular';

@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [..., IgxGridModule],
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Then you need to define the igxTransactionService as provider for the Grid or on some of its parent components:


```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { IgxGridTransaction, IgxTransactionService } from "igniteui-angular";

@Component({
    providers: [{ provide: IgxGridTransaction, useClass: IgxTransactionService }],
    selector: "app-grid-with-transactions",
    template: "<ng-content></ng-content>"
})
export class GridWithTransactionsComponent { }

```



> [!NOTE]
> `IgxGridTransaction` is injection token defined by the grid.

Then define a Grid with bound data source and [`rowEditable`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#roweditable) set to true and bind:


```html
<app-grid-with-transactions>
    <igx-grid #gridRowEditTransaction [data]="data" [primaryKey]="'ProductID'" width="100%" height="500px"
        [rowEditable]="true">
        ...
    </igx-grid>
</app-grid-with-transactions>
...
<button igxButton [disabled]="!undoEnabled" (click)="undo()">Undo</button>
<button igxButton [disabled]="!redoEnabled" (click)="redo()">Redo</button>
...
<button igxButton (click)="commit()">Commit</button>
<button igxButton (click)="discard()">Discard</button>
...

```





The following code demonstrates the usage of the [`transactions`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxtransactionservice.html#) API - undo, redo, commit.

```typescript
...
export class GridBatchEditingSampleComponent {
    @ViewChild("gridRowEditTransaction", { read: IgxGridComponent }) public gridRowEditTransaction: IgxGridComponent;
    ...
    public get undoEnabled(): boolean {
        return this.gridRowEditTransaction.transactions.canUndo;
    }

    public get redoEnabled(): boolean {
        return this.gridRowEditTransaction.transactions.canRedo;
    }

    public undo() {
        this.gridRowEditTransaction.transactions.undo();
    }

    public redo() {
        this.gridRowEditTransaction.transactions.redo();
    }

    public commit() {
        this.gridRowEditTransaction.transactions.commit(this.data);
        this.toggle.close();
    }

    public discard() {
        this.gridRowEditTransaction.transactions.clear();
    }
}
```




> [!NOTE]
> Disabling [`rowEditable`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html#roweditable) property will modify Grid to create transactions on cell change and will not expose row editing overlay in the UI.
