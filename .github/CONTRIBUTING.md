# Writing an article

When writing an article about a specific component, it is important to have a plan that you stick to. This will improve the overall cohesion of the text, making it more structured and clear for the reader.

There are a few questions one can ask, when charting such plan.

### 1. What is this article about (objective)?

    a. List required previous knowledge to better understand the concept of the topic. For instance, if the article is about a directive feature, put references to the ng directives in the beginning of the article.

    b. Identify common use cases. Where would said component/directive be used in most often. Try to outline samples around said use cases.

### 2. What are the prerequisites to using said component/directive?\*\* Does it depend on other components, or can it be used on its own?

### 3. How does one get started with using said component/directive?

### 4. Identify the most important feature(s) of a component/directive.

    Why was a feature implemented? What problem does it solve? How important is that feature for the overall weight of the component? Can this component exist without the feature and still be perceived useful? Rank features by importance and write about the most important ones.

### 5. What are some common gotchas about a component/directiveâ€™s feature?

    Does the feature require any previous knowledge? If yes, then refer the user to it.

### 6. Can we identify some problems that may occur when using said component/directive?

    If yes, we can anticipate questions and have a troubleshooting section where we outline such issues and how to solve them.

### 7. Do we have a summary of the article and component APIs?

### 8. Where does one find further help related to the topic of the article?
